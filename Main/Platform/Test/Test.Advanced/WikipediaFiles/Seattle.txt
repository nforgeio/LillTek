Seattle is the western terminus of [[Interstate 90|I-90]] and resides on the [[Interstate 5|I-5 corridor]], about {{convert|140|mi}} south of [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], and {{convert|170|mi}} north of [[Portland, Oregon]]. The city of [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], British Columbia's capital, is about {{convert|110|mi}} to the northwest (about {{convert|90|mi}} by passenger ferry) while the [[eastern Washington]] hub city of [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] lies {{convert|280|mi}} to the east.

The first permanent European-descended settlers, [[Arthur A. Denny]] and those subsequently known as the [[Denny Party]], arrived November 13, 1851. Early settlements in the area were called &quot;New York-Alki&quot; (&quot;Alki&quot; meaning &quot;by and by&quot; in [[Chinook Jargon]]) and &quot;Duwamps&quot;. In 1853, [[David Swinson Maynard|Doc Maynard]] suggested that the main settlement be renamed &quot;Seattle&quot;, an [[English language|anglicized]] rendition of the name of Sealth, the chief of the two local tribes. From 1869 until 1982, Seattle was known as the &quot;Queen City&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=181 | title= Seattle receives epithet Queen City in 1869 | publisher=HistoryLink | author=Greg Lange |date=November 4, 1998 | accessdate=October 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seattle's current official nickname is the &quot;Emerald City&quot;, the result of a contest held in 1981;&lt;ref name=&quot;emeraldcitynickname&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.seattlest.com/archives/2005/10/27/were_not_in_washington_anymore.php | title=We're not in Washington Anymore | publisher=Seattlest | date=October 27, 2005 | accessdate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=3622 Seattle becomes The Emerald City in 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; the reference is to the lush evergreen forests of the area.

It is particularly known as a hotbed of &quot;green&quot; technologies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://school.eecs.wsu.edu/node/848 School.eecs.wsu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; stemming in part from the strong and relatively non-controversial stances its public leaders have taken on policies regarding urban design, building standards, clean energy and climate change (Seattle in February 2010 committed itself to becoming North America's first &quot;climate neutral&quot; city, with a goal of reaching zero net per capita greenhouse gas emissions by 2030).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicola.net/2010/02/22/council-wants-city-to-go-carbon-neutral-in-20-years/ Publicola.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, nominal land settlements were established. On January 14, 1865, the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle with a [[trustee model of representation|board of trustees]] managing the city. Two years later, after a petition was filed by most of the leading citizens, the Legislature disincorporated the town. The town remained a precinct of King County until late 1869 when a new petition was filed and the city was re-incorporated with a [[Mayor-council government]].&lt;ref name=founding/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Seattle has a history of boom and bust cycles, as is common to cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources. Seattle has risen several times economically, then gone into precipitous decline, but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure.&lt;ref name=shear&gt;{{cite journal|author=Emmett Shear|title=Seattle: Booms and Busts | publisher=Yale University | date=Spring 2002}} Author has granted blanket permission for material from that paper to be reused in Wikipedia. Now at [[wikisource:Seattle: Booms and Busts]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such boom, covering the early years of the city, was fueled by the lumber industry. (During this period the road now known as Yesler Way was nicknamed &quot;Skid Road&quot;,&lt;ref name=yesler&gt;{{cite web | author=Junius Rochester | url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=286 | title=Yesler, Henry L. |publisher=HistoryLink | date=October 7, 1998 | accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the timber skidding down the hill to [[Henry Yesler]]'s sawmill. This is considered a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider American lexicon as ''[[Skid Row]]''.)&lt;ref name=shear/&gt; Like much of the American West, Seattle saw numerous conflicts between labor and management, as well as ethnic tensions that culminated in the [[History of Seattle before 1900#Relations between whites and Chinese|anti-Chinese riots of 1885–1886]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=George Kinnear | url=http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Chinese_Riots_At_Seattle | title=Anti-Chinese Riots At Seattle, Wn..

Martial law was declared, and federal troops were brought in to put down the disorder. Nevertheless, the economic success in the Seattle area was so great that when the [[Great Seattle fire]] of 1889 destroyed the [[central business district]], a far grander city center rapidly emerged in its place.&lt;ref name=fire&gt;{{cite web | author= Walt Crowley | url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5115 | title=Seattle burns down in the Great Fire on June 6, 1889. | publisher=HistoryLink | date=January 25, 2003 | accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finance company [[Washington Mutual]], for example, was founded in the immediate wake of the fire.&lt;ref name=Klondike-foundings&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/klse/hrs/hrs0.htm | title=Hard Drive to the Klondike: Promoting Seattle During the Gold Rush | publisher=[[National Park Service]] | date=February 18, 2003 |accessdate=October 1, 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071103062325/http://www.nps.gov/klse/hrs/hrs0.htm |archivedate = November 3, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This boom was followed by the construction of a park system, designed by the [[Frederick Law Olmsted|Olmsted brothers]]' landscape architecture firm.&lt;ref name=shear/&gt; However, the [[Panic of 1893]] hit Seattle hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= J.

=== Gold Rush, World War I, and the Great Depression ===
[[Image:Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition - Rainier Vista.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]] had just over 3.7&amp;nbsp;million visitors during its 138-day run&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=696 | title=Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition's final day is on October 16, 1909.|publisher=HistoryLink | author=Greg Lange |date=January 14, 1999 | accessdate=November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The second and most dramatic boom and bust resulted from the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], which ended the depression that had begun with the [[Panic of 1893]]; in a short time, Seattle became a major transportation center. On July 14, 1897, the ''S.S. Portland'' docked with its famed &quot;ton of gold&quot;, and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in Alaska and the Yukon. Few of those working men found lasting wealth, however; it was Seattle's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run. Along with Seattle, other cities like [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]], [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], and [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], all in the Puget Sound region, became competitors for exchange, rather than mother-lodes for extraction, of precious metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=687 | title=Klondike Gold Rush | publisher=HistoryLink.org | date=January 14, 1999 | author=Greg Lange | accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century and funded many new Seattle companies and products. In 1907, 19-year-old [[James E. Casey]] borrowed $100 from a friend and founded the American Messenger Company (later [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]). Other Seattle companies founded during this period include [[Nordstrom]] and [[Eddie Bauer]].&lt;ref name=Klondike-foundings /&gt; The Gold Rush era culminated in the [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]] of 1909, which is largely responsible for the layout of today's [[University of Washington]] campus.&lt;ref name=aypexpo&gt;{{cite web | author=Greg Lange | url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5371 | title=Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition opens for a 138-day run on June 1, 1909.| publisher=HistoryLink |date=May 5, 2003 | accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town; the subsequent retrenchment led to the [[Seattle General Strike|Seattle General Strike of 1919]], the first [[general strike]] in the country.&lt;ref name=generalstrike&gt;{{cite web | author=Patrick McRoberts | url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=861 | title=Seattle General Strike, 1919, Part I | publisher=HistoryLink | date=February 4, 1999 | accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1912 city development plan by [[Virgil Bogue]] went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the [[Great Depression]], experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the [[Maritime Strike of 1934]] cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the [[Port of Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;BOLA Architecture + Planning &amp; Northwest Archaeological Associates, Inc., [http://www.portseattle.org/downloads/business/realestate/development/northbay/Appendix_I_Historic_Cultural.pdf Port of Seattle North Bay Project DEIS: Historic and Cultural Resources], Port of Seattle, April 5, 2005, p. 12-13 (which is p. 14-15 of the PDF). Retrieved July 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seattle was also the home base of impresario [[Alexander Pantages]] who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting [[vaudeville]] acts and silent movies. His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek went on and became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival [[John Considine (Seattle)|John Considine]], Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. The several theaters [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born, Seattle-based architect [[B. Marcus Priteca]] built for Pantages in Seattle have all been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many of their theaters survive in other cities of the USA, often retaining the ''Pantages'' name.

=== Post-war years: aircraft and software ===
War work again brought local prosperity during World War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The local economy dipped after war, which had also led to the dispersion of the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen as a consequence of [[Japanese American internment]]. The local economy rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial [[airliner]] market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.seeseattle.org/media/presskits/PKHistory.asp | title=History of Seattle: The &quot;Jet City&quot; Takes Off | publisher=Seattle's Convention and Visitors Bureau | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061002171554/http://www.seeseattle.org/media/presskits/PKHistory.asp | archivedate=October 2, 2006| accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the [[Century 21 Exposition]], the [[1962 World's Fair]].&lt;ref name=worldsfair&gt;{{cite web | author=Alan J.

[[Image:Seattle 07752.JPG| thumb|[[Downtown Seattle]] is bounded by Elliott Bay (lower left), lower Broadway (from upper left to lower right), Yesler Way (lower right), and Denny Way (obscured by clouds).]]

Seattle is located between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) to the west and Lake Washington to the east. The city's chief harbor, Elliott Bay, is an inlet of Puget Sound. To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the [[Kitsap Peninsula]] and [[Olympic Mountains]] on the Olympic Peninsula; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the [[Eastside (King County, Washington)|eastside]] suburbs, are [[Lake Sammamish]] and the [[Cascade Range]]. Lake Washington's waters flow to Puget Sound through the [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]] (consisting of two man-made canals, [[Lake Union]], and the [[Hiram M. Chittenden Locks]] at [[Salmon Bay]], ending in [[Shilshole Bay]]).

The sea, rivers, forests, lakes, and fields surrounding Seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world's few sedentary hunter-gatherer societies. The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing, skiing, bicycling, camping, and hiking year-round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

North of the city center, [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]] connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington. It incorporates four natural bodies of water: [[Lake Union]], Salmon Bay, Portage Bay, and [[Union Bay (Seattle)|Union Bay]].

Seattle's climate is usually described as [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic or Marine west coast]], with fairly mild, wet winters and mild, relatively dry summers. Like much of the [[Pacific Northwest]], according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] it falls within a cool, dry-summer subtropical zone (''Csb''), with cool-summer [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] characteristics such as its usually dry summers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Temperature extremes are moderated by adjacent Puget Sound, the greater Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington. The region is partially protected from Pacific storms by the [[Olympic Mountains]] and from Arctic air by the [[Cascade Range]]. Despite being on the margin of the [[rain shadow]] of the Olympic Mountains, the city has a reputation for frequent rain.&lt;ref name=rainshadow&gt;{{cite web

The [[Puget Sound Convergence Zone]] is an important feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited by the Cascade Mountains to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection.&lt;ref name=convergencezone&gt;{{cite news

Another exception to Seattle's dampness may occur in [[El Niño]] years, when the marine weather systems track as far south as California and little precipitation falls in the Puget Sound area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The [[Space Needle]], dating from the Century 21 Exposition [[Century 21 Exposition|(1962)]], is Seattle's most recognizable landmark, having been featured in the logo of NBA sports team the ''[[Seattle SuperSonics]]'', the television show ''[[Frasier]]'' and the backgrounds of the television series ''[[Dark Angel (TV series)|Dark Angel]]'', ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' and ''[[iCarly]]'', and films such as ''[[It Happened at the World's Fair]]'', ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'', and ''[[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse]]''. The fairgrounds surrounding the Needle have been converted into [[Seattle Center]], which remains the site of many local civic and cultural events, such as [[Bumbershoot]], [[Northwest Folklife|Folklife]], and the [[Bite of Seattle]].

Seattle's professional sports history began at the start of the 20th century with the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association|PCHA's]] [[Seattle Metropolitans]], which in 1917 became the first American hockey team to win the [[Stanley Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5414 | title=Seattle Metropolitan hockey team wins the Stanley Cup on March 26, 1917. | publisher=HistoryLink | author=Greg Lange | date=March 14, 2003 | accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today Seattle has three major professional sports teams: The [[National Football League]]'s [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Seattle Mariners]], and [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Seattle Sounders FC]].

That same year, the Seattle Mariners tied the all-time single regular season wins record with 116 wins. The NBA All-Star game was also held in Seattle twice, the first in [[1974 NBA All-Star Game|1974]] at the Seattle Center Coliseum and the second in [[1987 NBA All-Star Game|1987]] at the Kingdome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://seattlepi.com/allstar/ | title=2001 All-Star Game | publisher=''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' | date=July 11, 2001 | accessdate=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Qwest Field]] hosted the [[2005–06 NFL playoffs]]. In 2008, Qwest Field hosted the first game of the [[2007–08 NFL playoffs]], in which the Seahawks defeated the [[Washington Redskins]], 35–14. Qwest also serves as the home field for the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer. Seattle also boasts a strong history in collegiate sports. The [[Washington Huskies|University of Washington]] and [[Seattle Redhawks|Seattle University]] are [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] schools.

Some notable athletes include Felix Hernandez, who won the 2010 AL Cy Young award, among others.

=== Outdoor activities ===

Also popular are hikes and skiing in the nearby Cascade or [[Olympic Mountains]] and kayaking and sailing in the waters of Puget Sound, the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], and the [[Strait of Georgia]].

Seattle's economy is driven by a mix of older industrial companies, and &quot;new economy&quot; Internet and technology companies, service, design and clean technology companies. The Port of Seattle is a major economic engine. Though it has been affected by the recent recession, Seattle has retained a comparatively strong economy, and remains a hotbed for start-up businesses, especially in green building and clean technologies: it was ranked as America's #1 &quot;smarter city&quot; based on its government policies and green economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smartercities.nrdc.org/cities/seattle-wa Smartercities.nrdc.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The Seattle housing market, especially in center-city neighborhoods, has not seen the sort of drop in value most housing markets around the nation have seen in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_26/b4137033250949.htm Businessweek.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Seattle region's economy is increasingly diverse and multi-sectoral.

Still, very large companies dominate the business landscape. Three companies on the 2008 [[Fortune 500]] list of the United States' largest companies, based on total revenue are headquartered in Seattle: Internet retailer [[Amazon.com]] (#100), coffee chain [[Starbucks]] (#241), and department store [[Nordstrom]] (#270).&lt;ref name=Fortune500&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/states/WA.html| title=Fortune 500 list for Washington |publisher=Fortune Magazine| date=May 3, 2010|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Fortune 500 companies popularly associated with Seattle are based in nearby Puget Sound cities. Warehouse club chain [[Costco]] (#29), the largest retail company in Washington, is based in [[Issaquah, Washington|Issaquah]]. [[Providence Health &amp; Services]], the largest health care system and the fifth largest employer, is based in Renton, Washington. [[Microsoft]] (#44) and [[Nintendo]] of America are located in [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]]. [[Weyerhaeuser]], the forest products company (#147), is based in Federal Way. Finally, [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]] is home to truck manufacturer [[PACCAR]] (#169), and to international mobile telephony giant T-Mobile's U.S. subsidiary, T-Mobile USA.&lt;ref name=Fortune500/&gt;

Prior to moving its headquarters to [[Chicago]], aerospace manufacturer [[Boeing]] (#27) was the largest company based in Seattle. Its largest division is still headquartered in nearby Renton, and the company has large aircraft manufacturing plants in Everett and Renton, so it remains the largest private employer in the Seattle metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.komotv.com/news/archive/4095196.html | title=Locke Unveils Boeing 7E7 Tax Cut Wish List | publisher=KOMO News |date=June 9, 2003|accessdate=October 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to spark a new economic boom driven by the [[biotechnology]] industry in 2006. Major redevelopment of the [[South Lake Union, Seattle|South Lake Union]] neighborhood is underway, in an effort to attract new and established biotech companies to the city, joining biotech companies [[Corixa]] (acquired by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]), Immunex (now part of Amgen), [[Trubion]], and ZymoGenetics. [[Vulcan Inc.]], the holding company of billionaire [[Paul Allen]], is behind most of the development projects in the region. While some see the new development as an economic boon, others have criticized Nickels and the [[Seattle City Council]] for pandering to Allen's interests at taxpayers' expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = George Howland Jr.|title=The Billion-Dollar Neighborhood|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/June 23, 2004/news/the-billion-dollar-neighborhood.php | publisher=Seattle Weekly |date=May 23, 2004|accessdate = September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2006, ''Expansion Magazine'' ranked Seattle among the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation for climates favorable to business expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Expansion Magazine|url=http://www.expansionmanagement.com/smo/newsviewer/default.asp?cmd=articledetail&amp;articleid=17713&amp;st=3 |date=August 15, 2006 | title=2006 Mayor's Challenge: Where Are the Best Metros for Future Business Locations? | author=Bill King |accessdate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked Seattle as the most expensive American city for buying a house based on the local income levels.&lt;ref name=Clemence&gt;{{cite news | author=Sara Clemence |url=http://www.forbes.com/realestate/2005/07/14/overpriced-cities-lifestyle-cx_sc_0715home_ls.html | title=Most Overpriced Places In The U.S. 2005 | publisher=Forbes magazine|date=July 14, 2005|accessdate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government and politics ==
[[File:Seattle City Hall 01.jpg|thumb|Seattle City Hall, 2007]]
{{Main|Government and politics of Seattle}}
Seattle is a charter city, with a [[Mayor-council government|Mayor–Council]] form of government. Since 1911, Seattle's nine [[Seattle City Council|city councillors]] have been elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions.&lt;ref name=archive-chrono&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/Facts/councilchron.htm |title=Seattle City Council Members, 1869-present Chronological Listing | publisher=Seattle City Archives | accessdate=July 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other elected offices are the [[district attorney|city attorney]] and Municipal Court judges. All city, county, and state offices are technically [[Non-partisan democracy|non-partisan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www2.ci.seattle.wa.us/ethics/votersguide.asp?e=20071106&amp;p=01_03 | title=Seattle Form of Government | publisher=City of Seattle | author=Ethics and Elections Commission | accessdate=October 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (where people can pass or reject laws), referendums (where people can approve or reject already passed legislation), and Propositions (where specific government agencies can propose new laws/tax increases directly to the people)

Seattle's politics are strongly liberal/progressive, although there is a small [[libertarianism|libertarian]] movement within the metro area.&lt;ref name=Liberal&gt;{{cite news | url=http://seattlepi.com/local/236320_liberal12.html | title=Where have Seattle's lefties gone? | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Neil Modie | date=August 15, 2005 | accessdate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most liberal cities in the United States, with approximately 80% voting for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]; only two precincts in Seattle—one in the [[Broadmoor, Seattle|Broadmoor]] community, and one encompassing neighboring [[Madison Park (Seattle)|Madison Park]]—had a majority of votes for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[George W. Bush]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]. In addition, all precincts in Seattle voted for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], including the two precincts who had previously voted Republican in 2004.&lt;ref name=Liberal/&gt; In partisan elections for the [[Washington State Legislature]] and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats.

Seattle is one of the most politically [[Progressivism|progressive]] cities in North America, with an overwhelming majority of voters supporting Democratic politicians; support for liberal issues such as same-sex marriage, reproductive rights and gun control is largely taken for granted in local politics. Like much of the [[Pacific Northwest]] (which has the lowest rate of church attendance in the United States and consistently reports the highest percentage of [[atheism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religionatlas.org/religion_region/COASTALNORTHWEST.htm Religion and Public Life in the Pacific Northwest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/2002/2002-03-07-no-religion.htm | work=USA Today | title=Charting the unchurched in America | date=March 7, 2002 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), church attendance, religious belief and political influence of religious leaders is much lower than in other parts of America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_prac2.htm Religious identification in the U.S&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Seattle also has a thriving alternative press, with two well-established weekly newspapers, several online dailies (including the [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer|Seattle P.I.]], Publicola and Crosscut), and a number of issue-focused publications, including the nation's two largest online environmental magazines, [[Worldchanging]] and [[Grist.org]].

Federally, Seattle is part of [[Washington's 7th congressional district]], representated by Democrat [[Jim McDermott]], elected in 1988 and one of Congress' most liberal members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nationaljournal.com/voteratings/house/lib.htm | title= Special Report: 2006 Vote Ratings House Liberal Scores | publisher=National Journal | accessdate=September 28, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public school system is supplemented by a moderate number of private schools: five of the private high schools are Catholic, one is Lutheran, and six are secular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/schoolguide/search.php?search=criteria&amp;grade_low=9&amp;grade_high=12&amp;school_city=Seattle&amp;district_id=&amp;school_zip=ZIP+code&amp;pl_code%5B%5D=P | title=School Guide | work=The Seattle Times | accessdate=October 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seattle is home to one of the United States' most respected public research universities, the [[University of Washington]], as well as its professional and continuing Education unit, [[University of Washington Educational Outreach]]. A study by ''Newsweek International'' in 2006 cited UW as the twenty-second best university in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14321230/ | title=The Complete List: The Top 100 Global Universities | publisher=Newsweek International Edition | date=August 13, 2006 | accessdate=November 2, 2007 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070315053646/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14321230/ | archivedate=March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seattle also has a number of smaller private universities including [[Seattle University]] and [[Seattle Pacific University]], both founded by religious groups; universities aimed at the working adult, like [[City University of Seattle|City University]] and [[Antioch University]]; colleges, such as North Seattle Community College, Seattle Central Community College, and South Seattle Community College; and a number of arts colleges, such as [[Cornish College of the Arts]] and [[The Art Institute of Seattle]]. In 2001, ''Time'' magazine selected [[Seattle Central Community College]] as community college of the year, stating the school &quot;pushes diverse students to work together in small teams&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000725,00.html | publisher=Time magazine | title=Seattle Central | date=September 10, 2001 | accessdate=September 28, 2007 | author=Andrew Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Washington is consistently ranked among the country's top leading institutions in medical research, earning special merits for programs in neurology and neurosurgery. Seattle has seen local developments of modern paramedic services with the establishment of [[Medic One]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=cobb&gt;{{cite web | url=http://depts.washington.edu/mednews/vol6/no33/cobb.html |title=Cobb honored as one of &quot;Resuscitation Greats&quot; | publisher=UW School of Medicine Online News | date=August 16, 2002 | accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' story on the success of the then four-year-old Medic One paramedic system called Seattle &quot;the best place in the world to have a heart attack&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.metrokc.gov/health/medicone/history.htm | title=King County Medic One: A History of Excellence | publisher=King County | date=March 29, 2007 | accessdate=October 3, 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070707064715/http://www.metrokc.gov/health/medicone/history.htm |archivedate = July 7, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of Seattle's largest medical centers are located on First Hill. [[Harborview Medical Center]], the public county hospital, is the only [[Trauma center|Level I]] [[trauma center|trauma hospital]] serving Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uwmedicine.org/Facilities/Harborview/CentersOfEmphasis/Trauma/ | title=Trauma Center | publisher=UW Medicine | accessdate=October 3, 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024055225/http://www.uwmedicine.org/Facilities/Harborview/CentersOfEmphasis/Trauma/ |archivedate = October 24, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Mason Medical Center]] and [[Swedish Medical Center]]'s two largest campuses are also located in this part of Seattle, including the [[Virginia Mason Hospital]].  This concentration of hospitals resulted in the neighborhood's nickname &quot;Pill Hill&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002445189_virginiamason19.html | title=Pill Hill property sells for a bundle | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Tom Boyer | date=August 19, 2005 | accessdate=October 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the [[Laurelhurst, Seattle|Laurelhurst]] neighborhood, [[Seattle Children's]], formerly Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center, is the pediatric referral center for Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. The [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] has a campus in the Eastlake neighborhood and also shares facilities with the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and University of Washington Medical Center. The University District is home to the [[University of Washington Medical Center]] which, along with Harborview, is operated by the University of Washington. Seattle is also served by a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] hospital on [[Beacon Hill, Seattle|Beacon Hill]], a third campus of Swedish in Ballard, and [[Northwest Hospital and Medical Center]] near [[Northgate Mall (Seattle)|Northgate Mall]].

{{Main|Transportation in Seattle}}
{{further|[[Street layout of Seattle]]}}
The first streetcars appeared in 1889 and were instrumental in the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines. The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail in Seattle. Tacoma–Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett–Seattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by inexpensive automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the arrival of [[trolleybus]]es brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941. This left an extensive network of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region.&lt;ref name=interurbanrail&gt;{{cite news | author=Walt Crowley | url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=2667 |title=Interurban Rail Transit in King County and the Puget Sound Region – A Snapshot History | publisher=HistoryLink.org | date=September 19, 2000 | accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Link Tunell Sound transit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Central Link]] light rail trains in the [[Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel]] under the [[International District, Seattle|International District/Chinatown.]]]]
[[King County Metro]] provides frequent stop bus service within the city and surrounding county,as well as a [[South Lake Union Streetcar|streetcar]] line between the [[South Lake Union, Seattle|South Lake Union]] neighborhood and Westlake Center in downtown.&lt;ref name=slustreetcar&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/transportation/slustreetcar.htm |title=The South Lake Union Streetcar | publisher=Seattle Department of Transportation | accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seattle is one of the few cities in North America whose bus fleet includes electric trolleybuses. [[Sound Transit]] currently provides an express bus service within the metropolitan area; two [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder]] [[commuter rail]] lines between the suburbs and downtown; and its [[Link Light Rail|Central Link]] [[light rail]] line, which opened in 2009, between downtown and Sea-Tac Airport gives the city its first rapid transit line that has intermediate stops within the city limits. [[Washington State Ferries]], which manages the largest network of ferries in the United States and third largest in the world,&lt;ref name=ferries&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/your_wsf/index.cfm?fuseaction=our_history | title=History | publisher=Washington State Department of Transit | accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; connects Seattle to [[Bainbridge Island, Washington|Bainbridge]] and [[Vashon, Washington|Vashon Islands]] in Puget Sound and to [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]] and [[Southworth, Washington|Southworth]] on the [[Kitsap Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=ferries/&gt;

According to the 2007 American Community Survey, 18.6&amp;nbsp;percent of Seattle residents used one of the three public transit systems that serve the city, giving it the highest transit ridership of all major cities without heavy or [[light rail]] prior to the completion of Sound Transit's Central Link line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=2007 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=adp&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_DP3&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_&amp;-tree_id=308&amp;-keyword=Seattle&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-geo_id=16000US5363000&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en | accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=New Yorkers are Top Transit Users | publisher=CNNMoney.com | url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/13/real_estate/public_transit_commutes/index.htm | author=Les Christie | date=June 29, 2007 | accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]], locally known as Sea-Tac Airport and located just south in the neighboring city of [[SeaTac, Washington|SeaTac]], is operated by the [[Port of Seattle]] and provides commercial air service to destinations throughout the world. Closer to downtown, [[Boeing Field]] is used for general aviation, cargo flights, and testing/delivery of Boeing airliners.

The main mode of transportation, however, relies on Seattle's streets, which are laid out in a [[cardinal direction]]s [[grid plan|grid pattern]], except in the [[central business district]] where early city leaders Arthur Denny and [[Carson Boren]] insisted on orienting their plats relative to the shoreline rather than to true North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=315 | title=Maynard, Dr. David Swinson (1808-1873) | publisher=HistoryLink | author=Junius Rochester | date=November 10, 1998 | accessdate=October 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two roads, [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and [[Washington State Route 99|State Route 99]] (both limited-access highways), run uninterrupted through the city from north to south. State Route 99 runs through downtown Seattle on the [[Alaskan Way Viaduct]], which was built in 1953. However, due to damage sustained during the [[2001 Nisqually earthquake]] the viaduct will be replaced by a tunnel in 2015 at a cost of US$4.25 billion.

From 2006 to 2008, transit ridership in Seattle went up by 23%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psrc.org/assets/2122/t6jun09.pdf PSRC.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and many bus routes in the central part of the city are routinely forced to leave passengers because they are full. Seattle now has the worst traffic congestion of all American cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2009/11/30/daily14.html | title=Seattle has nation's worst traffic congestion: Study | date=December 2, 2009 | first=Puget | last=Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has started moving away from the automobile and towards mass transit. In 2006, voters in King County passed proposition 2(Transit Now) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five Bus Rapid Transit lines called RapidRide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingcounty.gov/transportation/kcdot/metrotransit/transitnow.aspx Kingcounty.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; After rejecting a roads and transit measure in 2007, Seattle-area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 that increases ST Express bus service and extends the Link Light Rail system (currently {{convert|15.7|mi|km}} with {{convert|3|mi|km}} under construction) by over thirty miles, and expands and improves Sounder commuter rail service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://future.soundtransit.org/ Future.soundtransit.org]&lt;/ref&gt; An extension of the light rail south to the [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]] began service on December 19, 2009; an extension north to the [[University of Washington]] is under construction as of 2010; and further extensions are planned to reach [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]] to the north, [[Des Moines, Washington|Des Moines]] to the south, and [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]] and [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]] to the east by 2023.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundtransit.org/Projects-and-Plans/Projects-By-Service/University-Link.xml Soundtransit.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/flatpages/local/2008proposition1guide.html | title=Sound Transit: What you'll pay, what you'll get | publisher=Seattle Times | date=2008-11-20 | accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundtransit.org/Documents/pdf/projects/MAP_ST2Sound%20Move.pdf Soundtransit.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor [[Michael McGinn]] hopes to put another transit measure on the 2011 ballot to build light rail from Downtown Seattle to Ballard, Fremont, and West Seattle&lt;ref&gt;[http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2009/12/22/mcginn-may-for-push-light-rail-vote-in-2010 Slog.thestranger.com]&lt;/ref&gt; after seeing a surprisingly large amount of support for it from its campaign (and now city's) policy forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideasforseattle.org/forums/27772-general Ideasforseattle.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
