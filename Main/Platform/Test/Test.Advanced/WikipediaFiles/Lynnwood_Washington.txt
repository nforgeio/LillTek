'''Lynnwood''' is a city in [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish County]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[United States]]. The population was 35,836 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], making it the fourth largest in Snohomish County and twenty-ninth largest in Washington State. The city is an indefinable mix of urban, suburban, small city, crossroads and bedroom community to many professionals who work in [[Seattle]]. Lynnwood is known to be the &quot;hub city&quot; of south [[Snohomish County]] because of all the retail shopping. Straddling the junction between [[Interstate 5 (Washington)|Interstate 5]] and the north end of [[Interstate 405 (Washington)|Interstate 405]] in Washington, it is the final tangle of population on the north end of &quot;greater Seattle&quot; before one continues on to other places: [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], or [[Vancouver, BC]]. Its climate is wet and cool, wetter than that of Seattle. The center of the town at 44th Avenue West and 196th Southwest has the usual American panoply of small businesses, [[strip mall]]s, and retail stores. Outside the commercial center of Lynnwood, to the east and north, lie [[Alderwood Mall]], houses, and portions of the green belt.

==History==
Lynnwood was officially incorporated on April 23, 1959, from a larger unincorporated area called [[Alderwood Manor]]. The area was originally platted, developed, and sold as {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} lots designed for raising chickens. Even today you can see many of the original 80 year old homes that were the chicken ranches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Satterfield |first=Archie |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Edmonds, The First Century |year=1990 |publisher=City of Edmonds |location=Edmonds, WA |isbn=0-9625484-0-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and old buildings. [[Image:Mtlyn.jpg|thumb|left|Former [[Masonic Temple (Alderwood Manor, Washington)|Masonic Temple]] built in 1919 still stands today near 36th Ave W and 196th St Sw in Lynnwood.]]

The name &quot;Lynnwood&quot; comes from a developer from [[Seattle]] who planned to build something at [[Washington State Route 99|Highway 99]] and Alderwood Road (now 196th ST SW). He named the building &quot;Lynn&quot; for his wife and &quot;wood&quot; for Alderwood. Many other stores around took the name Lynnwood and were known as the Lynnwood Business District.

The initial center of the incorporated city was the intersection of [[Washington State Route 99|State Route 99]] (Highway 99) and [[Washington State Route 524|State Route 524]] (196th Street SW). When [[Interstate 5 (Washington)|I-5]] was built, the exit onto 44th Avenue West became the main Lynnwood exit. At that time, the city zoned the area East of 48th W, south of 194th SW, and west of the new freeway for commercial development, and the current city center area was born, with the construction of the [[Fred Meyer]] store, a new hotel called the Landmark (now [[La Quinta Inns &amp; Suites]]) on 200th and 44th, and other commercial developments.

With the planned construction of [[Interstate 405 (Washington)|I-405]] bringing more people by the city, developers built the [[Alderwood Mall]], effectively moving the main commercial area even farther east.

==Geography==
Lynnwood is located at {{coord|47.827868|-122.305391|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}} (47.827868, -122.305391).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 7.7&amp;nbsp;square miles (19.8&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), of which, 7.6&amp;nbsp;square miles (19.8&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of it is land and 0.04&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of it (0.26%) is water.

Natural features within Lynnwood include Scriber Lake, Hall Lake, and [[Swamp Creek (Washington)|Swamp Creek]].

==Landmarks==
[[Image:Lynnwood.jpg|thumb|left|Overlooking [[Alderwood Mall]] on the intersection of 188th and 36th.]]
Other than the Alderwood Mall and the City Center, there are few notable city landmarks.

The Pine Cone Cafe on 188th SW and Highway 99 was open for decades.  It resembled greatly [[Beth's Cafe]] about fifteen miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) south on 99 in Seattle and was historically a big draw for Lynnwood's now long gone biker culture.  The interior was like a rail car with tables on each side of a central aisle.  In the rear were two very playable pinball machines.  Many teenagers came to the restaurant just to play pinball during the mid-1970s.  In more recent times the Pine Cone was very popular among counter-culture teenagers in general, and seniors as well.  No longer a restaurant, it is currently a smoke shop named &quot;Crown Smoke.&quot; Jimbos, a burger restaurant that closed down in 2006 due to excavation was a well known burger restaurant for families to go out and eat.

On 164th St. SW and Highway 99 lies Keeler's Corner, an old-fashioned gas station long out of service (not to be confused with Keeler's Corner Apartments, which is across the street). The Pantry Cafe on Lincoln and Highway 99 was burned down in 2004, but before the accident its legacy was certainly considerable. Most locals are familiar with the House of Clocks, an old-fashioned clock store, on 156th and Highway 99. A little farther south on Highway 99 was the Sno-King Drive-In which opened in 1946 and closed in 1986. Now a [[Value Village]] occupies the site of the former drive-in theatre. The local bowling and roller skating center, Lynnwood Bowl &amp; Skate (formerly Lynnwood Lanes and Lynnwood Roll-A-Way), on 200th St. SW and Highway 99 opened for business in the 1950s and still operates today.
